# Project1-Group4

# Main Research Question:

    Hypothesis: There is a relationship between political influences, socioeconomic factors, and COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States.
 
# Sub Questions: 

    How did the number of vaccinations and boosters administered impact the administration of vaccines and death rates, among different age groups?
       
    How factors like socioeconomic level and political influence affect vaccine doses administered?

# Vaccines Administered vs. COVID-19 Cases

    Vaccines administered peaked in March 2021 
    
    Downward secular trend for vaccines administered between March 2021 and July 2021
    
    Upward trend in vaccines occured between September 2021 and December 2021 (second peak) followed by a downward secular trend that lasted until March 2022. 
    
    Confirmed COVID-19 cases peaked in January 2022
    
    A seasonal trend occurs in 2021 and 2022 between July and August as cases are slightly elevated during these months

# Age vs Vaccines Administered

    The number of vaccines administered by age group was analyzed to see which age group had the most vaccines administered to them by single dose or series. 
    The number of vaccines administered by county was analyzed to see how many single dose and series vaccinations were administered by county. 

# Death Rates
    Assess death rates by vaccination status across age groups.
    Death rates highest in 65+ group but reduced with vaccination. Youngest age group (5-11) had minimal death rates. 
    Unvaccinated consistently showed higher death rates across all ages                               
    Data represents a specific timeframe.
    Broad age categories used.
    Limited to dataset's regional origin.
    Vaccination, especially booster doses, plays a key role in reducing severe outcomes.


Political Influence
Hypothesis: Correlation with Party Affiliation in the US
Data represents 66% of the total voter turnout
